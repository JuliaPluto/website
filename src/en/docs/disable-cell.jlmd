# Disabling cells
Pluto allows you to **disable a cell**, which means that it will not get executed with reactivity. When one of the dependencies of a disabled cell changes, the disabled cell will **not** get executed as usual.

Disabled cells are indicated by a 'greyed-out' appearance. Pressing the "Run" button (Shift-Enter) will **not** execute the cell, but it will save any changes to the cell code.

In this video, the disabled cell no longer responds to changes in the `count` variable. (The same applies when `count` is defined in code, instead of with a slider.)

### Reactive
The cell disabling feature is **reactive** – any cells that depend on a disabled cell will **also be disabled**. This ensures that the notebook remains consistent, and there is no code that executes with old values that no longer exist.

This is also a really powerful feature, because you can easily disable a large number of cells at once, by disabling a core cell that is used in all of them.

It is no longer reactive, and the cell that depends on it is also disabled." style="aspect-ratio: 998/528; max-width: 100%;" src="$(root_url)/assets/img/disable cell indirect.mp4" controls="controls" muted="muted" loop="loop" playsinline></video>

In this video, the last cell is disabled indirectly, because it depends on the disabled cell through the `text` variable.





## Other uses
Disabling a cell can also be useful for other purposes, such as:
- **Dramatic effect**: You can use this when showing a piece of code, but you don't want to show the result yet.



{#disable-in-file}
# Disabling in file
There is also the option to **disable a cell in the file**. This makes no difference when running the notebook in Pluto, but the cell code will be stored as a Julia comment in the file.

This is useful when you are writing a Pluto notebook file (`.jl`) that is also used as a Julia script. This lets you write code that is only executed when the notebook is used in Pluto, such as additional plots, testing, or more.

_Notice the gray markers to the right of the cells, marking a cell disabled in file (second cell) and a cell disabled indirectly in file (last cell)._


### File format
Before the cell is disabled in file, the `.jl` notebook file looks like:

```julia
# ╔═╡ d5697b7b-a916-468c-9a2a-e84a87d7320f
@bind count Slider(5:20)

# ╔═╡ 6a653410-c595-45fb-8357-6ffe815e9d49
text = repeat("🎈", count)

# ╔═╡ 94216444-bcfb-4925-bc16-44b698181286
sum(codeunits(text))
```

After disabling the second cell in file, you get:

```julia
# ╔═╡ d5697b7b-a916-468c-9a2a-e84a87d7320f
@bind count Slider(5:20)

# ╔═╡ 6a653410-c595-45fb-8357-6ffe815e9d49
# ╠═╡ skip_as_script = true
#=╠═╡
text = repeat("🎈", count)
  ╠═╡ =#

# ╔═╡ 94216444-bcfb-4925-bc16-44b698181286
#=╠═╡
sum(codeunits(text))
  ╠═╡ =#
```


### Reactive
The _Disable in File_ feature is **reactive**, just like the ["Disable" feature](#disable). This means that any cells that depend on a cell that is disabled in file will **also be disabled in file**. The reasons here are similar: it makes sense for consistency, and it makes it easy to disable a large number of cells at once.
