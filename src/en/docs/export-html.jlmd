# Export to HTML
This is a snapshot of your notebook with all outputs in a standalone HTML file. You can share this `.html` file via email, and other people can double-click the file to read your notebook. 

!!! info
    Important: you can open an HTML export file **on any computer**, you do not need to have Julia or Pluto installed!

For some examples of HTML export files, check out our [featured notebooks](https://featured.plutojl.org/).


> ### Step 1
> Open your notebook in Pluto, and wait for all cells to finish running.
> 
> ### Step 2
> Press the **Share** button in the top right.

## Reproducibility
What's really cool about HTML export files is that they are **reproducible**: every HTML export file from Pluto **includes the `.jl` source code**! That means that someone who reads the notebook can also run the original code and make changes!

Every HTML export contains an **Edit or run** button in the top right. When you press it, you see a screen where you can:
1. Run the notebook with **[binder](https://mybinder.org/)**, a free service to run scientific notebooks in the cloud. This works on any browser (including mobile), without needing to install Julia or Pluto.
2. **Download the `.jl` notebook file** that was used to generate the HTML export. You can open this file with Pluto.

`.html` files from Pluto can also be used as web pages on your blog. <a href="../notebooks-online/" class="arrow">Learn more</a>
