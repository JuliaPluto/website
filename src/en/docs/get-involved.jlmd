## How to contribute
Take a look at our [localization documentation](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/tree/main/frontend/lang) to get started! We look forward to your contributions! 💛

## How to give Feedback
Can't collaborate directly? No worries! We're happy to receive your feedback and implement it ourselves. Use the feedback form for complaints, praises, nice-to-haves, or any suggestions you might have, we're always glad to hear from you!

The easiest way to reach us: Use the built-in feedback tool at the bottom right of each notebook. 👨‍🏫

- Your feedback goes directly to the Pluto developers in a private database
- Feedback is anonymous by default, but you can optionally leave your email address
- We might contact you for more details or to share a solution 😉

You can also reach us through Julia community channels:
- [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)
- [JuliaLang zulip](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/pluto-developer-instructions/blob/main/How%20to%20join%20the%20Pluto%20zulip.md) - we have a Pluto channel, just pop by!
- [JuliaLang slack](https://julialang.slack.com)

Or email us directly :) you can find Pluto developers' email addresses on their GitHub profiles.

Especially for students and teachers:
- Using Pluto to teach? We'd love to think together about your course
- Learning Julia with Pluto? Let us know how it's going and what could be better

We're working to make Pluto helpful for new Julia users, so your feedback is invaluable! 🎉
