# Linking to sections
You can use `#` in a URL to link to a specific section of a Pluto notebook. You can link to:
- global variables with `#variable_name`
- function definitions with `#function_name`
- Markdown headers with `#header-text` _(see below for instructions)_

### Within a notebook
You can use Markdown hyperlinks to link to a different section of the same notebook. For example, if you define a variable `fruits = ["apple", "pear"]` at the top of your notebook, then you can link to it with:

```julia
md"\""
Take a look at [the fruits variable](#fruits).
""\"
```

Clicking on the link will jump straight to the definition of `fruits`.


### A section in a notebook online
You can also link to a specific section of a notebook online. For example, if your notebook is hosted at:

<a href="https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7"><code>https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7</code></a>

Then I can link to sections by adding the `#` hash to the URL. For example, to link to the `example_step` variable:

<a href="https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7#example_step"><code><span style="opacity: .6;">https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7</span><strong>#example_step</strong></code></a>

Or I can link to the header "Adding color":

<a href="https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7#Adding-color"><code><span style="opacity: .6;">https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7</span><strong>#Adding-color</strong></code></a>


## Linking to variables and functions
All global variables (and functions, types, etc.) are automatically linkable in Pluto notebooks. The variable name is the link text.

!!! tip
    You can use this to make items linkable! For example, if you want to link to a plot (which usually has no id), you can add a "dummy variable" `my_plot = 123` inside the cell that creates the plot, and then link to it with `#my_plot`.


## Linking to Markdown headers
When you hover over a Markdown header, you can click the ðŸ”— button to copy the header id to your clipboard. This will copy a string like `#Adding-color` to your clipboard, which you can then paste somewhere to use as URL.

<img src="$(root_url)/assets/img/copy-header-id.png" alt="screenshot of a Pluto notebook, showing a Markdown header and the button to copy the header id" width="992" height="596">

When you are reading a notebook online (instead of editing on localhost), the button will copy not just the header id, but the full URL to the header, like `https://pluto.land/n/lp7p4qk7#Adding-color`.


!!! info
    This feature is only available in Pluto 0.20.13 and later.
