> You don't need to be an expert to write a featured notebook! The notebooks are designed to help beginning Pluto users get underway with their own ideas; as such, short tutorials on basic Julia concepts, or short examples of neat ideas, are very much welcome, and are a great way to contribute to the Julia community when you're still learning yourself.
> 
> That said, we also very much welcome experienced Julia programmers to share their work. Featured notebooks can highlight how you use Julia in your domain, bring attention to a neat package, or share exercises that you created for a course.
