# Courses taught with Pluto
Pluto.jl is a programming environment [designed for education](../education/) and is being used in several courses around the world. Pluto was developed alongside the free online course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) at MIT, with the goal of creating a programming environment that is powerful, helpful and interactive, without being too intimidating for students and teachers. 

## Featured courses
