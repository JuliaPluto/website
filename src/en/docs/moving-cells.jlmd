# Moving a single cell
 Pluto allows you to place your cells in **any order**. You can do this by dragging the cell from the left shoulder. A bold line shows where the cell will be moved to.

!!! tip
    Pluto's reactivity means that you can put cells in **any order**, and they will still execute correctly based on the dependencies between cells. This means that you can place cells in the order that makes the most sense for your story, which is not always the order that makes the most sense for the computer.
    
    For example, you can first tell your story using Markdown cells and plots, and then add a section `# Appendix` with package imports, helper functions and more.

# Selecting cells
You can select multiple cells, which is useful for moving them together. To select cells, **click between two cells and drag to make a selection**.

### Selecting cells on wide screens
If your window is wide enough, you can also use the **right margin** to start a selection:

### Moving multiple cells
You can move multiple cells by **Selecting multiple cells** and then dragging one of them.



### Copying cells
If you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> on Mac) while cells are selected, you can copy them to the clipboard. You can paste these cells in a notebook, or as plain text in another application.


### More actions
While multiple cells are selected, you can apply various actions to them simultaneously: moving, copying, deleting, folding and un-folding.

# Moving between notebooks
You can also move cells between different notebooks. To do this, [open two notebooks in two different windows](https://plutojl.org/en/docs/launch-pluto/), and place them side-by-side. You can now **drag cells between the two notebooks**, and they will be copied to the other notebook.
