# Notebook file <span id="jl"></span>
Pluto notebook files are **stored as `.jl` Julia files**. This file contains:
- Code for each cell
- Special comments (start with `#`) that Pluto uses to understand which code belongs to which cell.
- The exact version numbers of packages that were used. This is stored at the bottom of the `.jl` file, the Project.toml and Manifest.toml content.

When you send your `.jl` notebook file to someone else, they can open the notebook in Pluto and see the same results. This concept is called **reproducibility**, and it is something we work very hard on at Pluto!



### Step 1
Open your notebook in Pluto, and wait for all cells to finish running.

### Step 2
Press the **Share** button in the top right.

### Step 3
Choose "Notebook file".

!!! info
    The steps above are a quick way to get the `.jl` file. You can also **Save your notebook** on your computer by giving it a file name. In that case, the steps above just give a copy of your file.


## Notebooks as scripts
`.jl` notebook files can also be **run as a script**. Since the `.jl` file just contains your cell code, you can also run it with Julia:

```sh
> julia my_notebook.jl
```

The most useful application is to use `include("my_notebook.jl")` in the REPL or a script to get variables from your notebook outside of Pluto.
