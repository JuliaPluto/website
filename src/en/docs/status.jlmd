# Status tab
The status tab in Pluto shows you what is currently running. This includes cell execution, reactive code analysis, Pkg operations and starting the notebook process.

### Not visible on small screens
If your screen is not wide enough (like a phone screen), the Status tab is not visible. Try using your device in landscape mode, zooming out, or resizing the window.

## Notification ðŸ””
You can ask Pluto to send you a notification when all items are done. (This button appears at the bottom of the status tab after a couple of seconds of activity.) This is useful if you are doing something that takes a long time to run, and you want to work on something else while you wait.

Using this feature for the first time will prompt the browser to ask for permission to send you a notification.

## Current running cell
To jump to the cell that is currently running, you can either:
- Click on the task "Evaluating cells" â†’ "Running code" in the **Status tab**.
- Click on the orange **progress bar** at the top of the screen.
