## How to give Feedback
How is your experience with Pluto? Pluto has a built-in feedback form for complaints, praises, nice-to-haves, or any suggestions you might have, we're always glad to hear from you!

The easiest way to reach us: Use the built-in feedback tool at the bottom right of each notebook. 👨‍🏫

- Your feedback goes directly to the Pluto developers in a private database
- Feedback is anonymous by default, but you can optionally leave your email address
- We might contact you for more details or to share a solution 😉

- [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)
- [JuliaLang zulip](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/pluto-developer-instructions/blob/main/How%20to%20join%20the%20Pluto%20zulip.md) - we have a Pluto channel, just pop by!

Or email us directly :) you can find Pluto developers' email addresses on their GitHub profiles.

### Education
We are specially interested in feedback from students and teachers:
- Using Pluto to teach? We'd love to think together about your course
- Learning Julia with Pluto? Let us know how it's going and what could be better

We're working to make Pluto helpful for new Julia users, so your feedback is invaluable! 🎉
