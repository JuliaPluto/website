# Markdown in Pluto
Markdown is the easiest way to write text in Pluto notebooks. With Markdown, you can write text with **bold**, _italic_, and other formatting, and you can use it to add titles, lists, images, and more.

You use markdown with the `md"\""` string macro inside a Pluto cell:

```julia
md""\"
This text is in **bold** and _italic_.
""\"
```

> This is what that looks like in the notebook:

### Complete guide
Read more about Markdown in Pluto here:

$(begin
    import PlutoUI
    PlutoUI.NotebookCard("https://featured.plutojl.org/basic/markdown"; link_text="How use Markdown in Pluto")
end)


### Keyboard shortcut
When editing a cell, you can press `Cmd+M` or `Ctrl+M` to automatically add or remove the `md"\""` string macro.

### Julia cells and Markdown cells
Some notebook environments have different **cell types**: a *code* cell and a *Markdown* cell. In Pluto, there is **only one cell type**: a Julia cell. But you can use the Julia string macro `md"` to write Markdown inside of Julia! 🤯

### Markdown syntax
The library that provides the `md"` macro is the Julia standard library (stdlib) [Markdown](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/). This library might work a bit differently from the Markdown that you are used to in GitHub, Jupyter, or elsewhere.

# Other Markdown libraries
The Markdown stdlib is `using`ed by default in Pluto, but you are free to use other Markdown libraries. You can also use something other than Markdown, like HTML (with [HypertextLiteral.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/HypertextLiteral.jl)).

Some other Markdown libraries that you can use in Pluto:
- [CommonMark.jl](https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/CommonMark.jl)
- [MarkdownLiteral.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/MarkdownLiteral.jl)
