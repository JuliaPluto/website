# Export to PDF <span id="pdf"></span>
If you want to print your notebook, or submit it as homework assignment, it might be useful to get a PDF file! 

*When possible, we recommend sharing an HTML file instead of a PDF file. HTML files are great for **reproducibility**!*


### Step 1
Open your notebook in Pluto, and wait for all cells to finish running.

### Step 2
Press the **Share** button in the top right.

### Step 3
Choose "PDF".

## Page layout
Pluto tries to make your notebook look well on paper. One challenge is where to place "page breaks". Our goal is:
- Don't split cells between pages, unless necessary.
- Markdown headers should be at the top of a page.

*ðŸŒ¸ If your notebook does not look good on PDF, generate an [HTML export](#html) and send it to the Pluto developers! ðŸŒ¸*
